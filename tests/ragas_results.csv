The firm operates across multiple continents, employing a diverse and talented workforce dedicated to delivering high-quality design solutions.\nDespite this success, the firm faced a challenge with its employee management system.

It differs from other anonymous sharing apps such as PostSecret, Whisper, and Yik Yak in that it was intended for sharing primarily with friends, potentially making it more interesting and addictive for people reading the updates. It was founded by David Byttow, the former lead for Square Wallet, and Chrys Bader-Wechseler, a former Google product manager at Google+, Photovine and YouTube. Bader-Wechseler left the company in January 2015, with the stated reason that the company's shift away from detailed design and towards more minimalistic design meant that he felt he was no longer the best person to be at the helm of the company. Byttow announced the shutdown of the app and the company on April 29, 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Launch and initial buzz ===\nIn December 2013, TechCrunch reported the existence of Secret (then in stealth, so its purpose was unclear), and also that it was raising $1.2 million, based on a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\nThe app was released privately within Silicon Valley over the next two months. It started receiving press coverage in early February 2014, where it was revealed that the company had raised $1.4 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures, Alexis Ohanian and Garry Tan through their Initialized Capital vehicle, Index Ventures, Matrix Partners, SV Angel, and Fuel Capital. A number of technology news websites billed Secret as the latest craze in Silicon Valley.\nThe company had three employees and raised $8.6 million in its Series A round in March 2014.\nFalse rumors about an impending acquisition of Evernote were circulated via Secret in early February 2014. Business Insider reported rumors (circulated on Secret) that Secret was about to acquire Whisper, another anonymous sharing app.\nOn February 10, Mashable reported that clothing retailer Gap "", ""Suneel Gupta is an American entrepreneur, author, television host, and keynote speaker.

A sequel to Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (2004), it is set in the World of Darkness and follows an original narrative focused on the Elder vampire Phyre, who awakens in early 21st-century Seattle during a historic snowstorm. As the city's Camarilla struggles in the aftermath of a failed coup and a renewed inquisition, Phyre becomes entangled in the conflict between factions of vampires, hunters, and the resurgent Sabbat while uncovering the truth behind a mysterious brand suppressing their powers.\nPlayers control Phyre primarily from a first-person perspective, exploring an open-world depiction of Seattle divided into five districts. The game emphasizes traversal, investigation, dialogue, and supernatural combat, allowing players to customize Phyre's clan, abilities, outfits, and backstory. Feeding on humans replenishes blood used to power Disciplines (supernatural powers), while stealth, persuasion, and manipulation can shape relationships with characters and factions. \nDevelopment of Bloodlines 2 began under Hardsuit Labs in the mid-2010s before successive delays and production issues resulted in a shift to The Chinese Room in 2021. The Chinese Room retained the Christmas-time Seattle setting and much of the original art direction but rebuilt the game with a revised RPG system and narrative, while experiencing further delays. \nVampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 21 October 2025. The game received mixed critical reviews, drawing praise for its narrative, and criticism for the gameplay and design.

It was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, followed by North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and other regions following thereafter. As a fifth-generation console, the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn.\nSony began developing the PlayStation after a failed venture with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 1990s. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi and Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan, while additional development was outsourced in the United Kingdom. An emphasis on 3D polygon graphics was placed at the forefront of the console's design. PlayStation game production was designed to be streamlined and inclusive, enticing the support of many third party developers.\nThe console proved popular for its extensive game library, popular franchises, low retail price, and aggressive youth marketing which advertised it as the preferable console for adolescents and adults. Critically acclaimed games that defined the console include Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, and Final Fantasy VII. Sony ceased production of the PlayStation on 23 March 2006—over eleven years after it had been released, and in the same year the PlayStation 3 debuted. More than 4,000 PlayStation games were released, with cumulative sales of 962 million units.\nThe PlayStation signaled Sony's rise to power in the video game industry. It received acclaim and sold strongly; in less than a decade, it became the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units. Its use of compact discs heralded the game industry's transition from cartridges.

Trump is the second former U.S. president to return to office. Alongside Trump\'s second presidency, the Republican Party also currently holds majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate during the 119th U.S. Congress following the 2024 elections, thereby attaining an overall federal government trifecta.\nIn the first eight months of his second presidency, Trump signed over 200 executive orders, many of which have been or are being challenged in court. His attempts to expand presidential power and conflict with the courts have been described as a defining characteristic of his second presidency. The Trump administration has taken action against law firms for challenging its policies. On immigration, Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law, revived numerous immigration laws from his first presidency, attempted to restrict birthright citizenship, and initiated procedures for mass deportations, including nationwide raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In January 2025, Trump launched the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with Elon Musk briefly overseeing it.

He began his professional career as a teacher at the Dalton School. After his dismissal from the school in 1976, he entered the banking and finance sector, working at Bear Stearns in various roles, before starting his own firm. Epstein cultivated an elite social circle and procured many women and girls whom he and his associates sexually abused.\nIn 2005, police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein after a parent reported that he had sexually abused her 14-year-old daughter. Federal officials identified 36 girls, some as young as 14 years old, whom Epstein had allegedly sexually abused. Epstein pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He was convicted of only these two crimes as part of a controversial plea deal agreed by the US Department of Justice's Alex Acosta, and he served almost 13 months in custody but with extensive work release.\nEpstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. Barbara Sampson, the New York City medical examiner, ruled that his death was a suicide by hanging. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden has disputed the ruling, and there has been significant public skepticism about the true cause of his death, resulting in conspiracy theories. In July 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released CCTV footage to support the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell. When the Department of Justice released the footage, approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds of it was missing, and the video was found to have been modified despite the FBI's claim that it was raw.\nSince Epstein's death precluded the possibility of pursuing criminal charges against him, a judge dismissed all criminal charg"", ""The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise features many fictional elements, including locations, weapons, and artifacts.

Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.\nAmong Web professionals, ""Web development"" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.\nFor larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.\n\n\n== Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development ==\n\n\n=== Origin/ Web 1.0 ===\nTim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.\nThe primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with', 'Turn 2 U Inc. dba The Last Mile (TLM) is an Oakland, CA based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide opportunities for personal and professional growth for justice-impacted individuals through education and technology training. The Last Mile is celebrating more than a decade as an organization, originating with its first program in San Quentin State Prison with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
