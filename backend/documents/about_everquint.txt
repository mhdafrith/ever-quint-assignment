Drive your sales team to success with Sales Pipeline App
Perkins&Will is a leading name in global architecture and design, renowned for its innovative approach and dedication to excellence. With a presence spanning continents, the firm’s diverse teams bring visionary ideas to life, setting new benchmarks in design and creativity.
To complement their dynamic operations, we introduced a custom app that revolutionized their sales tracking. By integrating data from Excel, PowerBI, and Deltek into a unified dashboard, the platform simplifies lead tracking, streamlines pipeline management, and enhances deal closure. This has allowed teams to collaborate seamlessly, optimize budgets, and drive revenue growth.


Get Clear Insights into every Opportunity 
Our app offers a comprehensive view of every opportunity—location, status, team members, win probability, revenue estimates, and more. Clean visuals like tables and graphs make decision-making faster and more intuitive. 


At the top, you can quickly see whether the opportunity is still a lead, in the pursuit stage, awarded, or booked. Scrolling down, you’ll find all key information, including project location, win probability, and a detailed revenue breakdown. The “Team Member” section shows all active members involved in the project. By clicking the arrow next to “Team,” you can view their roles, areas of responsibility, and contact options.
Advanced Search and Sorting Made Simple
Efficiently manage projects with smart filters that refine data by studio, client, revenue, or stage. For instance, finding awarded leads in Chicago is as simple as selecting “Primary Studio: Chicago” and filtering by “Stage: Awarded.”

The more filters you apply, the more specific your project results will be. This feature is particularly useful if you have a diverse portfolio of leads and clients you find challenging to manage.
Monitor Revenue with Precision
Keep track of budgets, revenue, and financial performance in real-time. Gain actionable insights to identify high-priority opportunities and maximize profitability.

Transform Your Sales Process Today
With features like instant filtering, detailed opportunity insights, and real-time revenue tracking, our app is designed to make your sales process more efficient and effective. Whether you’re managing projects across multiple locations or keeping track of complex portfolios, our app provides the tools you need to succeed.

How We Took the Pain Out of People Management for Perkins&Will

How We Took the Pain Out of People Management for Perkins&Will
Perkins & Will is a globally recognized leader in the architecture and design industry, known for its commitment to creativity, innovation, and excellence. The firm operates across multiple continents, employing a diverse and talented workforce dedicated to delivering high-quality design solutions.
Despite this success, the firm faced a challenge with its employee management system. There was no centralized location to view employee details and their corresponding projects. Users had to navigate between different platforms—first going to UKG to find employee IDs, then switching to Deltek to locate project information.
To address this, we developed a unified portal that integrated employee data with their projects and pursuits, streamlining the process and improving overall efficiency.

The People app is designed to capture all the essential details about an individual within a company. Beyond basic information like name, email address, and job role, our app covers key aspects such as digital portfolios, recent activities, active projects, connections, and more. 
The layout is simple and intuitive. When you view a profile, you’ll find clear sections—like Information, Professional, Activities, Connections, Pipeline, and Projects—to help you quickly navigate and access the details you need. 
One of the key features is the ability to see who’s working on what project directly from the profile. No need to visit the pipeline app and search through various projects. Whether someone is actively engaged in a project or has moved on, their profile is always updated in real-time. 

So, even if a task is given to a person in the pipeline app, the activities section will keep track of the tasks that have been completed or remain. 
The connections section further covers the bookmarked list of important people outside the organization. In the contacts app, you can easily bookmark important people and they will show up in your connections in the people app. 

Got More Ideas to Enhance People Management?
We did all this for Perkins & Will, making people management much easier for them.
Are you also struggling with scattered employee data that makes it hard to track team progress? Do your teams feel frustrated switching between different platforms to find project details? Maybe managing resources across systems is slowing down your workflow?
If you’re facing challenges like these, our team is here to help.
